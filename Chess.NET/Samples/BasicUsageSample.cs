            // The Piece class is the abstract base class for pieces. All piece classes (e.g. Rook) derive from this class.

            // White has to make a turn. They want to move their E2 pawn to E4. Is that valid?

            // The return type is the MoveType enum. It holds one, or a combination, of these values: Invalid, Move, Capture, Castling, Promotion
            // Each valid move will always carry the 'Move' value. If it's also something else, it will carry both values (e.g. if the move is a capture, `type` will have the value MoveType.Move | MoveType.Capture).
            // MoveType is a flags enumeration. https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229062%28v=vs.100%29.aspx

            // Here it just returns 'None' because nothing special happened.
            // GameStatus has two other properties: PlayerWhoCausedEvent (quite self-explanatory) and EventExplanation (used if Chess.NET needs to be more specific about an event, e.g. when it's a draw, explaining why).

            // Now it's black's turn.
            Console.WriteLine("It's this color's turn: {0}", game.WhoseTurn);

            // Here it returns all valid moves for black, but you can also find all valid moves *from a certain position* by passing a Position instance as argument.
            Console.WriteLine("How many valid moves does black have? {0}", validMoves.Count());

            // It might happen that you don't really care about all valid moves, but just want to know if there are valid moves. Chess.NET also has a method for that:
            bool hasValidMoves = game.HasAnyValidMoves(Player.Black);
            // Again, you can also pass a Position instance here.
            Console.WriteLine("Black has any valid moves: {0}", hasValidMoves);
